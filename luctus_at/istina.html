                            <p>Istina is my project name for a gmod statistics addon that collects a lot of data about the server and players.<br>
                            This page exists to showcase a few statistics about the data collected so far.<br>
                            The banner and icon have been specially drawn for this project by Holly.</p>

                            <h2>Statistics</h2>
                            <p>Disclaimer: All these statistics are, if not otherwisely stated, done by calculating over all data, and not over unique players.<br>
                            This means that the longer you play, the more your statistics count.<br>
                            In the pictures you can easily distinguish between "playtime" and "unique" type of statistics by the file name.</p>
                            <h2>Screen Resolution</h2>
                            <hr>
                            <br>
                            <img class="luctusImage" src="images/istina/screensizes_playtime.png">
                            <p>The above image shows the screen resolution count of players by playtime. (+50.000 data points)<br>
                            More than 3/4th of players are playing in FullHD, while the other ones are mainly split into higher resolutions with different aspect ratios.<br>
                            <br>
                            We can also take a look at the unique players version of this graph:</p>
                            <img class="luctusImage" src="images/istina/screensizes_unique.png">
                            <p>As you can see above, the screen resolutions of only unique players (full pie chart consists of ~600 data points) is still more than 3/4th of FullHD players.<br>
                            <br>
                            This means that if you write your HUD only with FullHD screen resolution in mind then you are only neglecting less than 1/4th of the playerbase.</p>
                            </p>
                            
                            <h2>Gmod 64/32 bit versions</h2>
                            <hr>
                            <br>
                            <p>All the servers in this statistic do not tell players to upgrade to 64bit. This means this statistic is not influenced by specific servers pushing their players to one side.</p>
                            <img class="luctusImage" src="images/istina/jitver_playtime.png">
                            <p>If we look at the above pie chart we can see that, by playtime, a lot more players use the 64bit version of Garry's Mod than the 32bit version.</p>
                            <img class="luctusImage" src="images/istina/jitver_unique.png">
                            <p>But if we look at the unique version of this graph then we can see that the around 600 players split up into nearly exactly 50/50.<br>
                            This means it is not save to use 64bit-only features, as nearly half of the players are still using the 32bit version of the game. These features are, for example: Google Drive websites in the ingame browser.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Addons of players</h2>
                            <hr>
                            <br>
                            <img class="luctusImage" src="images/istina/addons.png">
                            <p>As the above scatter chart shows, most of the players have less than ~250 addons which are, combined in size, less than ~25GB in size.<br>
                            One special case is on the most top left corner, which shows that one player has over 2000 addons installed, which have a combined size of over 200GB.</p>
                            
                            <h2>Average FPS</h2>
                            <hr>
                            <br>
                            <img class="luctusImage" src="images/istina/avgfps_plycount.png">
                            <p>The above graph shows the average fps of every player on the server combined on the Y axis and the amount of players on the server on the X axis.<br>
                            This not only shows that im missing data on the right side, but also that the FPS on average decreases the more players are on the server.</p>
                            <img class="luctusImage" src="images/istina/avgfps_plytime.png">
                            <p>The above graph shows the average FPS of a player on the Y axis and the current session playtime on the X axis.<br>
                            This shows that the longer you play, the less FPS on average you have.</p>

                            <p>All the above statistics have been collected with my self-written, open source Garry's Mod addon called "istina" (or, if installed on your server, probably named luctus_monitor).<br>
                            Github link: <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/OverlordAkise/istina">https://github.com/OverlordAkise/istina</a><br>
                            All the data processed is anonymized.<br>
                            The statistical analysis was done with Python3 via Jupyterlab, using pandas for data storage and matplotlib for creating the graphs and charts.</p>
