# Setup a TTT server

This "guide" is for people who just want to setup a simple TTT server.  
Most of these addons are "kinda necessary" for TTT.  

## Setup server for TTT

To have your gmodserver run the TTT gamemode simply change the active gamemode to `terrortown`. TTT is preinstalled with gmod.

## Addons

These are, in my opinion, "must have" addons that nearly every server has.  
The download links to these addons will be in the brackets.  
Either subscribe to the addon or if it's a github link simply download and add it to your addons folder.  

WARNING: every addon-folder name has to begin with a lowercase letter after extracting it.  
Good: garrysmod/addons/<b>e</b>asychat  
Bad: garrysmod/addons/<b>E</b>asychat-master

You have to add these maps to a workshop collection.  
Then you can set the server up to use that workshop collection.  
This way the maps will be automatically downloaded when joining one.  
Do **NOT** let the user download every map upon joining the server.  
The user will automatically download the active map from the workshop if the map is from the workshop.  


## After installing

The following things still need to be done for your server to work correctly:

 - Change the ULX MOTD so that it contains your rules (No RDM, etc.)
 - Change things in the pointshop
 - Maybe change the karma autoban amount and ttt traitor chance
 - Add custom ULX roles
 - If you installed Autopromote: Set apromote time for ULX ranks
