# website-sources

A repository to manage my websites.

Please look out for license files!  
I only wrote the content of my 'luctus' website and not the design itself. The design is made by "html5up.net | @ajlkn" with a "CC BY 3.0" license.  
Everything else, if not explicitly specified, is licensed as "GNU GPLv3".

Current websites:

## Why upload your website?

I created an automated process that fetches git pushes and updates the websites accordingly. No more manual file copying from now on.
