# Luctus' Wiki

This page exists as a way to document *EVERYTHING* that I, OverlordAkise, ever learned about gmod and glua.  

No matter if lua, server-hosting or database knowledge - everything is documented here.

This wiki mainly covers topics, knowledge and guides that can't be found on the official gmod wiki.
